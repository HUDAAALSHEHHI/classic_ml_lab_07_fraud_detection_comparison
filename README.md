# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Imbalanced Data

This project demonstrates how to handle **imbalanced datasets** in fraud detection  
by using **resampling techniques** and evaluating models with metrics beyond simple accuracy.

## Contents
- `creditcard.csv` â€“ the dataset used in this project
- Notebook with full workflow for:
  - Data loading and exploration  
  - Handling class imbalance  
  - Training baseline and improved models  
  - Evaluating with precision, recall, and AUC  

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.  
2. Upload `creditcard.csv` to `/content` or mount your Google Drive.  
3. Run each cell in order.  
4. Compare the results of baseline vs. resampled models.

## Notes
- If the dataset is not available, the notebook can generate a **synthetic fallback dataset** for demonstration.  
- This project is part of the book *AI: The Gateway for Specialized Researchers*.
